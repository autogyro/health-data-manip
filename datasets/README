Usually, the older the individual, the more extensive the examination. 

Demographic data file variables are grouped into three broad categories: 

1.- Status Variables: Provide core information on the survey participant. 
Examples of the core variables include interview status, examination status, and sequence number.
(Sequence number [SEQN] is a unique ID number assigned to each sample person and is required to 
match the information on this demographic file to the rest of the NHANES 2007-2008 data.)

2.- Recoded Demographic Variables: 

The variables include age: 

*Age in months for persons under age 80, age in years for 1 to 80-year-olds, 
and a top-coded age group of 80 years and older.

*Gender, a race/ethnicity variable, 

Current or highest grade of education completed, less than high school, 
high school, and more than high school education), country of birth (United States, Mexico, or other foreign born), ratio of family income to poverty threshold, income, and a pregnancy status variable (adjudicated from various pregnancy-related variables). Some of the groupings were made due to limited sample sizes for the two-year dataset. (3) Interview and Examination Sample Weight Variables: Sample weights are available for analyzing NHANES 2007-2008 data. Most data analyses require either the interviewed sample weight (variable name: WTINT2YR) or examined sample weight (variable name: WTMEC2YR). The two-year sample weights (WTINT2YR, WTMEC2YR) should be used for NHANES 2007-2j08 i
