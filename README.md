# Machine Learning with Healthcare Data 

Collection of individual scripts and ipython notebooks illustrating my scratch development work towards the completion of the capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. As such, the scripts are entirely my own work and do not reflect the finished product nor constitute any type of reporting document. The completed project and report will be available on a separate repository. 

## Installation

Fork or clone GitHub repository and make sure you have a working Python 3 installation. To get the most of the scripts, make sure you have Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries installed in your Python environment.  The easiest way to add the required libraries is by using the tools provided by the Anaconda python distribution, https://www.anaconda.com.

`$ git clone https://github.com/juanerolon/health-data-manip.git`

**Manual installation of core libraries within a conda environment (if libraries not already present):**

`$ conda install numpy`  

`$ conda install scipy`  

`$ conda install matplotlib`  

`$ conda install pandas`

### Requisites

** Libraries **
- Sklearn 
- Tensorflow with GPU support
- Keras 
- Xgboost 
- Imbalanced-learn
- Feather format


## Usage

To run code inside Ipython notebooks you may open the file using Jupyter. From the command line:

`$ jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`

To run each individual script you may use your favorite IDE or run the script from the command line:

`$ python scriptname.py`

## Datasets

The datasets in `health-data-manip/datasets/` are in SAS XPT format.

The raw datasets and their descriptions are open source and were obtained from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2013. For more information visit:
